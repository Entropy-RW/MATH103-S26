     In this course, we will provide evidence for assessment of 
     Problem Solving. Students will apply appropriate methods to obtain conclusions. 
     More specifically, students will be able to:

    <paragraphs>
   <ol>
  <li> Clearly identify or define a problem.</li>
  <li>Use a discipline-specific model to perform an analysis or procedure.</li>
  <li>Draw a well-supported logical conclusion.</li>
   </ol>
    </paragraphs>
  </subsection>
    <p>These outcomes will be assessed on the final exam.</p>

     <ol>
  <li>Translate English expressions into expressions of 
    Propositional Logic to determine the relation between a 
    complex sentence and its parts in a systematic and unambiguous way.</li>
  <li>Employ methods of Propositional Logic, including truth tables, to determine 
    under what conditions statements are true or false, 
    and when logical arguments are valid or invalid.</li>
  <li>Use basic logic, algebra, counting 
    techniques, and combinatorics to solve problems 
    arising in a variety of contemporary application areas.</li>
