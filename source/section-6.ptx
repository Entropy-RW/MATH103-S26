  <title>When are our office hours?</title>

  <p>
    Office hours are the best way to ask your math questions and communicate anything about the course privately 
    (or as part of a group if you want). I provide both <term>in-person</term> and <term>Zoom office hours</term>.
  </p>

            <p>You can simply stop by my office, <term>RSS 348</term>, during the following time-slots:</p>
    
          <ul>
            <li>Mondays 11:00 AM–12:00 PM </li>
            <li>Wednesdays 12:40–1:40 PM </li>

        <li><term>No appointment is needed for in-person </term> office hours.</li>
        <li>In-person office hours are first come, first served.</li>
        <li>
          Please be <term>prepared</term> for office hours when you ask math questions.
          The purpose is to help you understand a concept or problems that you have spent time on
          (studied all related topics, read the textbook, solved other examples, etc.).
        </li>
        <li> No in-person office hours during the Spring break.</li>
      </ul>

    <title>Office hours by appointment (Zoom)</title>
    <p>
      If you cannot stop by in-person, you can make an appointment for Zoom office hours.
      To promote productivity and maximize time efficiency, online office hour appointments are made online 
      through <url href="https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/MathOfficeHours@cofc.edu/bookings/">Microsoft Booking</url>.
      Please see below for more details:
    </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Any appointments must be made via 
          <url href="https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/MathOfficeHours@cofc.edu/bookings/">this link</url>.
          If all office hours conflict with your course or work schedules, please send me an email with suggestions for an appointment.
        </li>
        <li>After clicking on the link, you need to use your CofC credentials to see available times.</li>
        <li>
          If there are available time slots, booking appointments need at least 24 hours and at most two weeks lead time.
          Please book one appointment in advance before making another one.
        </li>
        <li>
          After making an appointment, you will receive an automatic confirmation, which includes the Zoom link
          to our meeting and a <em>Manage booking</em> option.
          Follow that link to reschedule or cancel your appointment.
          If you must cancel or change your appointment, please do it as soon as possible.
        </li>
      </ul>
