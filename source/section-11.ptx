  <title>What else should we know about the quizzes and exams?</title>

  <ul>
    <li>Check OAKS frequently for due dates. No separate announcements will be sent for quizzes or tests.</li>

    <li>Quizzes will be online and posted in OAKS.
    </li>
   <li>Since each quiz requires only 10–15 minutes to 
   complete and remains available for at least four days before the due date, 
   <term>late submissions will not be accepted</term>.
   </li>
  <li>
    Makeup exams will only be offered under the most <term>severe circumstances</term>,
    such as serious illness, family emergencies, quarantine, etc.
    If you anticipate such an event, please notify me as soon as possible.
  </li>
  <li>
    I may not provide solutions for quizzes or exams.
    I encourage you to use office hours to ask your questions.
  </li>
  <li>
    You might be asked to explain your quizzes or exams in a private office-hours meeting.
    Your explanation may impact the grading of that assignment.
  </li>
  </ul>
  <subsection>
    <title>Active Participation</title>
    <p>
Ten percent of your grade is based on <term>active participation</term>, which means that you
regularly attend lectures, actively engage in class by asking and answering questions,
contributing to group work, and following the expectations discussed in
<xref ref="section-lecture-expectations"/>. 
Note that missing <term>four or more unexcused</term> lectures will result in a zero percent score for this component.
