  <title>What else should we know about the quizzes and exams?</title>

  <ul>
    <li>Check OAKS frequently for due dates. No separate announcements will be sent for quizzes or tests.</li>

    <li>Quizzes will be online and posted in OAKS.
    </li>
   <li>Since each quiz requires only 10–15 minutes to 
   complete and remains available for at least four days before the due date, 
   <term>late submissions will not be accepted</term>.
   </li>
  <li>
    Makeup exams will only be offered under the most <term>severe circumstances</term>,
    such as serious illness, family emergencies, quarantine, etc.
    If you anticipate such an event, please notify me as soon as possible.
  </li>
  <li>
    I may not provide solutions for quizzes or exams.
    I encourage you to use office hours to receive feedback on your performance.
  </li>
  <li>
    You might be asked to explain your quizzes or exams in a private office-hours meeting.
    Your explanation may impact the grading of that assignment.
