  <title>What is the <term>Honor</term> Code and the Code of Conduct?</title>

  <p>
    We must follow the
    <url href="https://charleston.edu/student-handbook/handbook/honor-code.php">
      Honor System
    </url>
    of the College of Charleston.
    I will assume all of us are trustworthy in our interaction with each other
    and adhere to the College of Charleston academic honor code.
  </p>

  <p>
    The first victim of violating the honor code is the person who did it by
    wasting opportunities, time, and resources for learning.
    The second victims are classmates, by taking away fairness from them.
    Because of the latter, should a violation of the honor code be discovered,
    it will be reported.

  Can I use Artificial Intelligence (AI) to complete my tests, quizzes or assignments?</title>

<p>The short answer is no. Here's why:</p>
<p>
AI is an impressive and evolving tool, but it often 
produces incorrect or misleading information--especially 
in mathematical subjects. 
I like to compare AI to a knife: 
in the hands of a trained surgeon, it can save lives; 
but in untrained hands, it can cause serious harm. 
Similarly, AI can be helpful when used with expertise, 
but it can mislead you if your foundational 
understanding isn't solid.

In this course, we're developing our mathematical skills. At this stage, 
it's easy to overlook subtle but critical mistakes made by AI. 
Relying on it to complete your work 
can undermine your learning and leave gaps in your 
understanding. 
Mastery comes from grappling with the 
material yourself, not from shortcuts that skip the learning process.
