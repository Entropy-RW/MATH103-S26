  <title>What should we expect during lectures?</title>

  <p>
    We should hold ourselves responsible for building a friendly, safe, and respectful environment
    where everyone benefits from our collective interaction.
    We will incorporate active methods of teaching during meetings to promote impactful learning.
    My ultimate goal is to enhance your critical thinking, communication, and collaboration skills,
    as well as grow your appreciation, passion, and curiosity for learning.
    We expect the following during meetings:

        Our lectures mostly will be <em>discussion-based</em>. It is required to participate in meetings
        and have an active role. I encourage you to engage during meetings by asking questions
        and participating in discussions.

        During meetings, I might solicit your thoughts on a question, topic, or discussion.
        This action helps us engage you and include you in our discussion. “I don’t know” is a perfect response;
        in this case, you benefit from reflecting on it.
      </li>
      <li>
        We might have group work to collaborate with other classmates during meetings;
        it is expected to contribute respectfully to group activities by sharing thoughts and ideas.
        I might ask a group or a student to present and share their work.
        It is understandable, acceptable, and sometimes expected not to know the correct answer.
        We learn by discovering topics that we don't know.
