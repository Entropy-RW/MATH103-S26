  <title>What should we expect during lectures?</title>

  <p>
    We should hold ourselves responsible for building a friendly, safe, and respectful environment
    where everyone benefits from our collective interaction.
    We will incorporate active methods of teaching during meetings to promote impactful learning.
    My ultimate goal is to enhance your critical thinking, communication, and collaboration skills,
    as well as grow your appreciation, passion, and curiosity for learning.
    We expect the following during meetings:

    <ul>
      <li>
        Our lectures mostly will be <term>discussion-based</term>. It is required to participate in meetings
        and have an active role. I encourage you to engage during meetings by asking questions
        and participating in discussions.
      </li>
      <li>
        During meetings, I might solicit your thoughts on a question, topic, or discussion.
        This action helps us engage you and include you in our discussion. “I don’t know” is a perfect response;
        in this case, you benefit from reflecting on it.
      </li>
   <li>
  We may have group work during meetings to collaborate with classmates.
  You are expected to contribute respectfully to group activities by sharing
  your thoughts and ideas. I may ask a group or an individual student to
  present and share their work. It is understandable, acceptable, and sometimes
  even expected not to know the correct answer. We learn by discovering topics
  that we do not yet know.


  <p>
    To enhance your group work experience, consider the following tips:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      If one of your teammates is quiet during discussion, engage them in the
      conversation by asking related questions, for example:
      “How do you feel about this idea?”
    </li>

    <li>
      Allow other teammates to contribute to the conversation.
      Do not dominate the group discussion.
    </li>

    <li>
      Challenge ideas, but do not judge others’ intellectual ability.
      If you think a teammate’s argument is incorrect, communicate respectfully,
      for example:
      “Because of X,Y, and Z reasons, I do not understand how your argument works.
      What am I missing?”
    </li>
  </ul>
</li>

      <li>
        Please inform me by email if you must miss a lecture.
        It is your responsibility to catch up on the materials covered in the lecture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Please do not eat or bring food in class.
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          It is <term>required</term> to read the textbook. Please keep in mind reading one page of a mathematical
book takes more time than the one of a novel. And, reading mathematical books requires
constant patience, thinking, and reflecting. Please manage your time accordingly.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

  <title>Taking Notes</title>
 <p>
I may not provide any notes, slides, or additional materials. It is your responsibility to take
notes during lectures. Developing strong note-taking skills is an important and useful academic
ability that will benefit you throughout your studies and professional career. Taking effective
notes helps you actively engage with the material, improve comprehension, and retain information
more efficiently. This course is an opportunity for you to practice and strengthen these skills,
which are essential for independent learning.
