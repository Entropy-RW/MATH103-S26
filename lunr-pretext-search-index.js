  "body": " What are the learning outcomes of MATH 103?     Prerequisites  Math 101 or placement    Course Description  This course is designed for students who are not planning to take more advanced mathematics courses and are interested in learning about the central role of Mathematics in the modern world. The course will help students develop analytical skills and the ability to read and write expositions of mathematical ideas suitable for a well-educated non-expert reader. A wide range of topics will be discussed, including logic, voting theory and fair division, graphs and networks, and symmetry in art and nature.    General Education Student Learning Outcomes  Students are expected to display a thorough understanding of the topics covered. In particular, upon completion of the course, students will be able to:    Model phenomena in mathematical terms.  Solve problems using these models.  Demonstrate an understanding of the supporting theory behind the models apart from any particular application.      Course Specific Student Learning Outcomes    Translate English expressions into expressions of Propositional Logic to determine the relation between a complex sentence and its parts in a systematic and unambiguous way.  Employ methods of Propositional Logic, including truth tables, to determine under what conditions statements are true or false, and when logical arguments are valid or invalid.  Use basic logic, algebra, counting techniques, and combinatorics to solve problems arising in a variety of contemporary application areas, that may include social sciences, management science, finance, and art.    These outcomes will be assessed on the tests and quizzes.   "

  "body": " What should we expect during lectures?  We should hold ourselves responsible for building a friendly, safe, and respectful environment where everyone benefits from our collective interaction. We will incorporate active methods of teaching during meetings to promote impactful learning. My ultimate goal is to enhance your critical thinking, communication, and collaboration skills, as well as grow your appreciation, passion, and curiosity for learning. We expect the following during meetings:    Our lectures mostly will be discussion-based . It is required to participate in meetings and have an active role. I encourage you to engage during meetings by asking questions and participating in discussions.  During meetings, I might solicit your thoughts on a question, topic, or discussion. This action helps us engage you and include you in our discussion. “I don’t know” is a perfect response; in this case, you benefit from reflecting on it.  We may have group work during meetings to collaborate with classmates. You are expected to contribute respectfully to group activities by sharing your thoughts and ideas. I may ask a group or an individual student to present and share their work. It is understandable, acceptable, and sometimes even expected not to know the correct answer. We learn by discovering topics that we do not yet know. To enhance your group work experience, consider the following tips:   If one of your teammates is quiet during discussion, engage them in the conversation by asking related questions, for example: “How do you feel about this idea?”  Allow other teammates to contribute to the conversation. Do not dominate the group discussion.  Challenge ideas, but do not judge others’ intellectual ability. If you think a teammate’s argument is incorrect, communicate respectfully, for example: “Because of these reasons, I do not understand how your argument works. What am I missing?”    Please inform me by email if you must miss a lecture. It is your responsibility to catch up on the materials covered in the lecture.  Please do not eat or bring food in class.     Classroom Technology and Device Use Policy  To maintain a respectful, focused, and safe learning environment during lectures and classroom activities, students are expected to follow the rules below.   Cell Phones and Devices   All cell phones, smartwatches, earbuds, and personal electronic devices must be turned off or set to silent during lectures.  Devices must be stored away unless explicit permission is given by the teacher for educational use.  Using devices for texting, calling, gaming, or social media during class is not permitted.     Photos, Videos, and Recording   Taking photos, videos, or audio recordings in the classroom is prohibited unless prior permission is granted by the teacher.  This includes recording the teacher, classmates, classroom materials, or presentations.  Sharing or posting any classroom-related content on social media is not allowed.     Exceptions   Exceptions may be granted for educational purposes with teacher approval.  Exceptions may also be made for documented medical or accessibility needs.     "

In-person office hours are first come, first served.  Please be prepared for office hours when you ask math questions. The purpose is to help you understand a concept or problems that you have spent time on (studied all related topics, read the textbook, solved other examples, etc.).      Office hours by appointment (Zoom)  If you cannot stop by in-person, you can make an appointment for Zoom office hours. To promote productivity and maximize time efficiency, online office hour appointments are made online through Microsoft Booking . Please see below for more details:    Any appointments must be made via this link . If all office hours conflict with your course or work schedules, please send me an email with suggestions for an appointment.  After clicking on the link, you need to use your CofC credentials to see available times.  If there are available time slots, booking appointments need at least 24 hours and at most two weeks lead time. Please book one appointment in advance before making another one.  After making an appointment, you will receive an automatic confirmation, which includes the Zoom link to our meeting and a Manage booking option.

Then think about how you built that skill. That is a recipe for success in learning. I highly recommend A Mind for Numbers by B. Oakley for learning how to learn mathematics.   Ask for help! We must be prepared for each lecture by reviewing recent topics, working through problems, and understanding assigned readings. The sooner you ask for help, the better the learning experience. Use resources such as the Center for Student Learning .   Time is precious! Let us spend our time learning—learning is earning. We have plenty of time if we add structure to our daily life. Please take advantage of office hours if you need help with time management.   CPH Approximation to Success:  curiosity + patience + hardworking success    "
