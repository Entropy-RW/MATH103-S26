  "body": " What should we expect during lectures?  We should hold ourselves responsible for building a friendly, safe, and respectful environment where everyone benefits from our collective interaction. We will incorporate active methods of teaching during meetings to promote impactful learning. My ultimate goal is to enhance your critical thinking, communication, and collaboration skills, as well as grow your appreciation, passion, and curiosity for learning. We expect the following during meetings:   Course and Attendance Policies   Our lectures mostly will be discussion-based . It is required to participate in meetings and have an active role. I encourage you to engage during meetings by asking questions and participating in discussions.  During meetings, I might solicit your thoughts on a question, topic, or discussion. This action helps us engage you and include you in our discussion. “I don’t know” is a perfect response; in this case, you benefit from reflecting on it.  We may have group work during meetings to collaborate with classmates. You are expected to contribute respectfully to group activities by sharing your thoughts and ideas. I may ask a group or an individual student to present and share their work. It is understandable, acceptable, and sometimes even expected not to know the correct answer. We learn by discovering topics that we do not yet know. To enhance your group work experience, consider the following tips:   If one of your teammates is quiet during discussion, engage them in the conversation by asking related questions, for example: “How do you feel about this idea?”  Allow other teammates to contribute to the conversation. Do not dominate the group discussion.  Challenge ideas, but do not judge others’ intellectual ability. If you think a teammate’s argument is incorrect, communicate respectfully, for example: “Because of X,Y, and Z reasons, I do not understand how your argument works. What am I missing?”    Please inform me by email if you must miss a lecture. It is your responsibility to catch up on the materials covered in the lecture.  Please do not eat or bring food in class.   It is required to read the textbook. Please keep in mind reading one page of a mathematical book takes more time than the one of a novel. And, reading mathematical books requires constant patience, thinking, and reflecting. Please manage your time accordingly.      Taking Notes  I may not provide any notes, slides, or additional materials. It is your responsibility to take notes during lectures. Developing strong note-taking skills is an important and useful academic ability that will benefit you throughout your studies and professional career. Taking effective notes helps you actively engage with the material, improve comprehension, and retain information more efficiently. This course is an opportunity for you to practice and strengthen these skills, which are essential for independent learning.    Classroom Technology and Device Use Policy  To maintain a respectful, focused, and safe learning environment during lectures and classroom activities, students are expected to follow the rules below.   Cell Phones and Devices   All cell phones, smartwatches, earbuds, and personal electronic devices must be turned off or set to silent during lectures.  Devices must be stored away unless explicit permission is given by the instructor for educational use.  Using devices for texting, calling, gaming, or social media during class is not permitted.     Photos, Videos, and Recording   Taking photos, videos, or audio recordings in the classroom is prohibited unless prior permission is granted by the instructor.  This includes recording the instructor, classmates, classroom materials, or presentations.  Sharing or posting any classroom-related content on social media is not allowed.     Exceptions   Exceptions may be granted for educational purposes with instructor approval.  Exceptions may also be made for documented medical or accessibility needs.     "

  "body": " What is the Honor Code and the Code of Conduct?  We must follow the Honor System of the College of Charleston. I will assume all of us are trustworthy in our interaction with each other and adhere to the College of Charleston academic honor code.  The first victim of violating the honor code is the person who did it by wasting opportunities, time, and resources for learning. The second victims are classmates, by taking away fairness from them. Because of the latter, should a violation of the honor code be discovered, it will be reported.  The Honor Code and the Code of Conduct can be found at this link .   Can I use Artificial Intelligence (AI) to complete my tests, quizzes or assignments?  The short answer is no. Here's why:  AI is an impressive and evolving tool, but it often produces incorrect or misleading information--especially in mathematical subjects. I like to compare AI to a knife: in the hands of a trained surgeon, it can save lives; but in untrained hands, it can cause serious harm. Similarly, AI can be helpful when used with expertise, but it can mislead you if your foundational understanding isn't solid. In this course, we're developing our mathematical skills. At this stage, it's easy to overlook subtle but critical mistakes made by AI. Relying on it to complete your work can undermine your learning and leave gaps in your understanding. Mastery comes from grappling with the material yourself, not from shortcuts that skip the learning process.   "

Then think about how you built that skill. That is a recipe for success in learning. I highly recommend A Mind for Numbers by B. Oakley for learning how to learn mathematics.   Ask for help! We must be prepared for each lecture by reviewing recent topics, working through problems, and reading the textbook. The sooner you ask for help, the better the learning experience. Use resources such as the Center for Student Learning .   Time is precious! Let us spend our time learning—learning is earning. We have plenty of time if we add structure to our daily life.
